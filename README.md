# Vue Challege
A little take home Vue/Javascript take home challenge. Shouldnt take too long, just a little something as a topic of conversation for the on site interview.

## Tasks

- [ ] can view all three JSON files merged in the `<table>`
- [ ] can sort the table by fields
- [ ] can filter table by field / value and clear filter
- [ ] can click a `<tr>` navigate to `countryEdit` route
- [ ] can edit the country in a form
- [ ] can return to `countryIndex` route and see the changes persisted in the table

> Im just using httpVueLoader here as to not have to setup a whole build step.
